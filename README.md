# OCR Project with Python and Tesseract

This project demonstrates how to use Python with the Tesseract OCR engine to extract text from images. The script processes images in the `input_images` directory and saves the extracted text to the `output_texts` directory.

## Introduction

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology used to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images taken by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. This project utilizes Tesseract, an open-source OCR engine, to perform text extraction from images using Python.

## Installation

1. **Install Tesseract-OCR**:
   - Download and install Tesseract from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
   
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ocr-project.git
   cd ocr-project

3. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install pytesseract pillow

4. **Usage**
   - 1. Place your images in the input_images directory.

   - 2. Run the OCR script:
     ```sh
     python ocr_script.py
     ```

   - 3. The extracted text will be saved in the output_texts directory.


## Script Explanation

### Setting Up Tesseract

We begin by providing the path to the Tesseract executable:
```code
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
```
> **_NOTE:_** Make sure to give the correct path to your Tesseract executable file.

### Preprocessing Images

For this tutorial, we directly use the images without additionl preprocessing. However, for better accuracy, you can add image preprocessing steps like grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and thresholding.

###  Performing OCR

The script reads each image file, performs OCR using Tesseract, and writes the extracted text to a text file:
```code
for filename in os.listdir(input_dir):
    try:
        if filename.endswith(".jpg") or filename.endswith(".png"):
            image_path = os.path.join(input_dir, filename)
            image = Image.open(image_path)

            text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

            output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, filename + ".txt")
            with open(output_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                f.write(text)

            print(f"Extracted text from {filename} and wrote to {output_path}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Image file not found: {image_path}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred for {filename}: {e}")
```

### Handling Exceptions
The script includes exception handling to manage common errors:

* **FileNotFoundError**: Raised if the image file is not found.
* **General Exception**: Catches any other unexpected errors.


### Examples

#### Input Image
Place your image files in the input_images directory. Hereâ€™s an example image:


### Output Text
After running the script, the extracted text will be saved in the output_texts directory. For the example image, the output text might look like this:

```
This is a sample text extracted from the image.
```
