Nature

Nature is my best friend,

| also calls it enviorment.

It helps us in many ways,

but why dont we return it in anyway?

Our selfishness is going so wrong,

We are cutting trees from so long.

Nature always helps us with its kindness,

And always gives its everything with a big happiness.
We should save nature together

And shall not damage it in anyway or the other.

We all love nature with all our heart,
And always consider it as our own part.
