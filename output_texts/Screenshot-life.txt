Life is a quality that distinguishes matter that has biological processes, such as signaling
and self-sustaining processes, from matter that does not. It is defined descriptively by the
capacity for homeostasis, organisation, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli,
and reproduction. All life over time eventually reaches a state of death and none is immortal.
Many philosophical definitions of living systems have been proposed, such as self-
organizing systems. Viruses in particular make definition difficult as they replicate only in
host cells. Life exists all over the Earth in air, water, and soil, with many ecosystems forming
the biosphere. Some of these are harsh environments occupied only by extremophiles.
